# 2. Dashboard:


## 2.1 parent region -- region selector:

manual table in dim.

```sql
SELECT TOP (1000) [parent_region],[region]
Â  FROM [BrokerData].[dbo].[dim_region_map_mf]
```

## 2.2 pmax open in select region linear & seasonal total:

* weekly on xaxis
* show value at end point
* automatically change focusing area

## 2.3 total pmax open vs P5TC figure and correlation:

max absolute correlation hit around at 10 days lag.
(after 10 days of pmax open show a pattern, p5tc show an opposite way trend)
corr at around .11 which is pretty low.
potential fixing way is to use more predictors to predict p5tc value.

## 2.4 prediction of pmax open based on machine learning prophet model.

prophet time series only.

```
root_mean_squared_error: 9.583665959563687
mean_absolute_percentage_error: 0.06236151615062029
```
 
## 2.5 prediction of P5TC rate based on machine learning prophet model use 10 days lag of all vars.

time series with additional variables (counts in area, count in open-dates categories.) lag 10 days. 

```
root_mean_squared_error: 1681.7049894061047
mean_absolute_percentage_error: 0.06836219432883675
