Thank you Samo, that s a lot of work there

Pls help us put this work in context.

Are these new zones showing loadings/discharges that did not appear in our Berthreport table?

How did you define if loadings or discharges of a given product are what s happening in those zones?

We have a list of all existing polygons in polygon.xlsb in the VTAS folder, is the next step adding missing zones to that list?

I see a few additions that will likely lead to changes in some of our files, like iron ore and coal loadings will definitely require Stanley and Luna to review our tonne grids/benchmarks

```

  

```

For your questions:

1.  Yes, these are new zones currently not in our Berthreport table.

They would be added to Berthreport table only after our team verified the information regarding to these zones are correct.

2.  The verification of information process would include three steps:

a)  The port/berth official website tells us its specific purpose of designation.

b)  The vessels in recent histories enter or exit that specific zone are exhibiting the pattern of loading or discharge (marked by dwt change) . Then we can tell if the berth is for loading or discharge or mixed.

c)  The vessels in recent histories enter or exit that specific zone are:

i.   Either from a well-known place of loading port (E.g.: Qinhuangdao),

ii.  Or targeting for a well-known discharging port (E.g.: Fangcheng).

iii.    And the satellite pictures of cargo matches our expectation. (E.g.: Coal).

We can conclude such berth is a loading/discharge berth of Coal

3.  After verified all info regarding to a berth, we can add it to `polygon.xlsb`, and one day after that this berth would be activated in Berthreport, and records would be captured in Berthreport table as well.
